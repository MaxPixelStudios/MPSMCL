MaxPixel Studios' Minecraft Launcher  
### Launcher Version Naming Specification 启动器版本命名规范
以这个做示例 For example: 0.1-a01  
0为代, 0为早期开发代, 1为一代, 以此类推。0 is the generation, 0 is an early development generation, 1 is 1st generation, and so on.  
1为当前代的版本号, 1为当前代中的第一个版本, 以此类推。1 is the version number in the current generation, 1 is the 1st version in the current generation, and so on.  
测试版会在后面加-axx或-bxx The test version will add -axx or -bxx at the end  
 - a为alpha, 功能测试阶段, 主要对新功能进行开发及测试。a is alpha, functional testing phase, mainly for the development and testing of new features.
 - b为beta, 稳定性测试阶段, 主要对代码, 性能与稳定性进行优化。b is beta, stability testing phase, mainly optimized for code, performance and stability.
 - xx为数字, 是当前测试版本的版本号。xx is a number, which is the version number of the current test version.
